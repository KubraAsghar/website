    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Your health questions answered.</p>
        
    <summary>How much exercise do I need per week?</summary>
    <p>Adults should aim for at least <strong>150 minutes</strong> of moderate aerobic exercise (e.g. brisk walking) or <strong>75 minutes</strong> of vigorous activity (e.g. running), plus strength training 2+ days per week.</p>
  
      
    <summary>What counts as moderate vs. vigorous activity?</summary>
    <p><strong>Moderate intensity:</strong> breathing faster but can still talk (e.g. brisk walking, light cycling).</p>
    <p><strong>Vigorous intensity:</strong> hard to speak more than a few words (e.g. running, fast swimming).</p>

        
    <summary>Do I need to exercise every day?</summary>
    <p>No. Focus on total weekly activity. Whether spread throughout the week or done in weekend "warrior" style sessions, meeting weekly targets yields benefits.</p>
  
       
    <summary>How often should I include strength training?</summary>
    <p>At least two days per week, working all major muscle groups: legs, hips, back, chest, shoulders, arms, and abdomen.</p>
  
      
  
    <summary>What should I eat to support training?</summary>
    <p>Eat a balanced diet with sufficient protein from animal or plant sources. Tailor intake to your activity level, age, and fitness goals.</p>
  
        
    <summary>Should I warm up, cool down, and rest?</summary>
    <p>Yesâ€”warm-ups prevent injury, cooldowns support recovery, and rest days avoid overtraining.</p>

    <h2>Supplements Guide</h2>
    <p>Several supplements can help support muscle growth when paired with resistance training and a well-rounded diet. This includes creatine and protein supplements, among others.</p>
      <h1>Creatine</h1>
      <p>
Creatine is a molecule naturally produced in your body. It provides energy for your muscles and other tissues.

Taking it as a dietary supplement can increase muscle creatine content by up to 40%Trusted Source beyond its normal levels.

Creatine affects muscle cells and exercise performance, promoting muscle gain. In fact, a large amount of researchTrusted Source shows creatine improves muscle strength.

This is good news if you’re trying to gain muscle. Greater strength allows you to perform better during exercise, leading to larger increases in muscle mass over time.

Creatine can also increase water content in your muscle cells. This may cause your muscle cells to swell slightly and produce signals for muscle growth.

Furthermore, this supplement may increase levels of the hormones involved in muscle growth, such as IGF-1.

Moreover, some researchTrusted Source shows that creatine could decrease the breakdown of proteins in your muscles.

Overall, many researchers have studiedTrusted Source creatine supplements and exercise, and one thing is clear: Creatine can help increase muscle mass.

          Creatine also has a positive safety profile.

          If you’re looking for a supplement to help you gain muscle, consider creatine first</p>
    <h1>  Protein supplements</h1><p>
Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle. Specifically, to gain muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural processes.

While it’s possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some people may struggle to do so. If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a protein supplement.

There are many protein supplements available, but some of the most popular are whey, casein, and soy protein. Other supplements contain protein isolated from eggs, split peas, rice, and hemp seeds.

ResearchTrusted Source shows that adding extra protein via supplements causes slightly more muscle gain in people who exercise than adding extra carbs. However, the effects are probably the largest for people who aren’t getting enough protein in their diet.

A 2018 studyTrusted Source including adult men and women suggests that total protein intake (including animal, fish, and egg protein) is important for building and preserving muscle mass.

However, in women, the association between total protein intake and muscle mass depended on physical activity.

Many people wonder how much protein to eat daily. If you’re an active individual trying to gain muscle, 0.6 to 0.9 grams (g) of protein per pound (lb) of body weight, or 1.4 to 2.0 g per kilogram (kg)Trusted Source of body weight, may be best.</p>
   <h1>   Weight gainers</h1>
<p>Weight gainers are supplements designed to conveniently help you get more calories and protein. They’re typically used by people who have difficulty gaining muscle, even when consuming large amounts of calories and lifting weights.

Although the calorie contents of weight gainer supplements vary, it’s not uncommon for some to contain more than 1,000 calories per serving.

Many people think these calories come from protein since it’s so important for muscle building. However, most of the calories actually come from carbs.

There are often 75 to 300 g of carbs, 20 to 60 g of protein, and 0 to 15 g of fat per serving in these high calorie supplements.

While these products can help you consume more calories, there’s nothing magical about weight gainer supplements.

A small 2012 studyTrusted Source involving physically inactive male and female adults found that drastically increasing calories can increase lean mass like muscle, as long as you eat enough protein.

However, a 2016 studyTrusted Source involving males who practiced resistance training suggests consuming a weight gainer supplement may not be effective for increasing lean mass.

    Overall, weight gainers are only recommended if you have difficulty eating enough food and find it easier to drink a weight gainer shake than eat more food.</p>
      <h1> Other supplements</h1><p>Several other supplements claim to increase muscle mass. These include conjugated linoleic acid, testosterone boosters, glutamine, and carnitine.

However, the evidence is mixed:

<h2>      Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA): </h2> <p>CLA refers to a group of omega-6 fatty acids that exert several effects on the body. A 2015 reviewTrusted Source of studies on CLA for muscle gain found mixed results, and it’s not clear whether it’s beneficial.</p>
      <h2>
          Testosterone boosters: </h2><p>Testosterone-boosting supplements include D-aspartic acid, Tribulus terrestris, fenugreek, DHEA, and ashwagandha. It’s likely these compounds only benefit people with low testosterone.</p>
      <h2>
Glutamine and carnitine:</h2> <p> These are probably not effective at increasing muscle mass in young or middle-aged active individuals. However, a small 2020 studyTrusted Source suggests that carnitine may have some benefits for muscle growth in older adults.</p>

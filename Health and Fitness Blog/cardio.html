    <h2>Cardio Training</h2>
    <p>Cardio training can take many forms. Here are some popular options, with outdoor workouts being more common in summer and indoor workouts gaining popularity in winter:</p>
     <h2> Outdoor:</h2>
<h3> Running –</h3> Ideal for those who enjoy being outdoors and want an efficient calorie burner.

<h3>Cycling –</h3> Great for building endurance while being easy on the joints, whether outdoors or on an indoor bike.

<h3>Walking – </h3>Perfect for beginners or those recovering from an injury.
      <h2>At Home:</h2>
